# Tableau-Public
This repository contains scripts used to create the VOTD colour analysis dashboard: https://public.tableau.com/profile/luisa6565#!/vizhome/VOTDColourAnalysis/Dashboard1.

"VOTD" scrapes all VOTDs including title, date and thumbnail.

"Dominant colour" is based on https://github.com/aysebilgegunduz/DominantColor and analyses the dominant colour in each VOTD thumbnail. It outputs the RGB codes to a DataFrame.
