# Tableau-Public
This repository contains scripts which scrape Tableau Public profiles and VOTDs.

"Tableau Public Profiles" scrapes viz name, view count and number of favourites from any given Tableau Public profile and stores them in a DataFrame.

"VOTD" scrapes all VOTDs including title, date and thumbnail.

"Dominant colour" is based on https://github.com/aysebilgegunduz/DominantColor and analyses the dominant colour in each VOTD thumbnail. It outputs the RGB codes to a DataFrame.
